[jessemichael.me](http://jessemichael.me) is a portfolio website showcasing my work, my interests, and my thoughts. For some people, it is their first impression of me. For others it's where to go to learn a little be more. For me it's where I learn new web technologies and try and show off. Over the years I have redone this website several times in several technologies as their popularity rises and as my need to keep this website up to date rises.

## 1.0
The [first verion](https://github.com/Jesse0Michael/jessemichael.me/tree/initial) of this website is endearing to look back on. I was just about to graduate from ASU with my Computer Science degree and needed something to show recruiters. I bought some GoDaddy hosting and began scraping together what I could. It was written in PHP (I don't ever remember writing PHP..) and used plenty of Flash.

## 2.0 
the [second version](https://github.com/Jesse0Michael/jessemichael.me/tree/aspx) was written in ASPX .NET. It is much more tolerable to be writing C#. With a decent reference, I've always been able to build interesting things, but at this point I still didn't have a full grasp at what I was doing with the technology and why.

## 3.0
the [third version](https://github.com/Jesse0Michael/jessemichael.me/tree/gh-pages) was written a couple years into my software career, this time using Angular JS with some JQuery and other Javascript that I picked up along with a better understaning of how things worked. I dropped my paid hosting and put the website up on Github Pages using Jekyll. I also dove into learning some html5 features, like using canvas and video. This version can still be viewed [here](http://jesse0michael.github.io/jessemichael.me/). 

## 4.0
the [forth version](https://github.com/Jesse0Michael/jessemichael.me/tree/master) took an exciting dive into the new web view framework that everybody is talking about! React! From all of my experiences with web development, organizing related css, javascript, and html together makes a lot of sense to me. Node.js was also a powerful new tool to start learning. For hosting, this time, I used Google's Firebase which you can find [here](https://jessemichael-auth.firebaseapp.com/). This time I brought a few extra tools that I have learned in other projects, including continuous integration using CircleCI which will build, test, and deploy the website.
